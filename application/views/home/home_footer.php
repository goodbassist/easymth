                <p>Our vision at <strong>STOM Academy</strong> is to make learning very simple and free for students all over the world. </p>
                <p>All students have different learning curves and many of them  have struggled with comprehension which has led to some students  repeating classes, others dropping out ,while others have resorted to cheating and involving in various examination malpractices.</p>
                <p> It is our vision to ensure that students understand and enjoy taught subjects in schools by creating graphics and animated videos with audio that will simplify learning. These videos will relate subjects to everyday living thereby reducing  abstraction in our taught subjects.</p>
                <p> We strongly believe that these videos will make learning fun, interesting, understandable and real thereby increasing thirst for knowledge and a desire to study. It will also reduce cheating and examination malpractices. Lastly, because of the visual presentation of the materials, it will aid the students in remembering taught subjects  and  improving their creativity.                  </p>
                <p>We hope we will get individuals and organizations that will partner with us in order to make these videos freely available to all schools all over the world.</p>
                <p> The e-maths is the first in the series of our animated videos, please click on enter site and start having fun with mathematics. </p>
